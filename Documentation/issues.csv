MDSchechtman/Terminal-Velocity,Track Controller - Track Model - IBlock,"Does the block need to know what track controller is controlling it? The IBlock Interface currently does not have this information, however, the TrackModel creates the Track Controllers. ITrackModel also does not contain information about the Track Controllers it creates. However the Track Controller has a dictionary of Blocks that it contains..

Can someone please clear this up, I essentially need to know how to get a track controller ID from a Block.",17/Nov/12  4:51 PM,28/Nov/12  9:35 AM,New feature,None,"",closed,mikeneiderhauser,https://github.com/MDSchechtman/Terminal-Velocity/issues/12

MDSchechtman/Terminal-Velocity,TrackController - CTCOffice Communication,"The CTCOffice references the first Track Controller.  Track Controllers check their request object on each tick - this is okay.

After a request object propagates through every track controller, it needs to be returned to the CTCOffice.  This needs to be implemented.

The CTCOffice should also check for an updated or changed Recieved_Request object every tick.

It does not make sense to create an event for this feature.",13/Nov/12  5:14 PM,15/Nov/12  1:02 AM,,Created,"",closed,MDSchechtman,https://github.com/MDSchechtman/Terminal-Velocity/issues/4
